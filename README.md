# qView
This fork of qView adds the following features:
* Option to constrain image position to keep it snapped inside the viewport.
* macOS: Option to persist session across app restarts.
* Shows zoom level in titlebar in Practical/Verbose mode.
* Custom titlebar mode based on format string.
* Option to make zoom level relative to screen pixels (for Windows/Linux users with DPI scaling enabled; not so useful in macOS due to the way it handles scaling).
* Option to disable smooth scaling above a specified zoom level.
* Menu toggle to preserve zoom level when changing between images.
* "Fill Window" zoom option.
* Ctrl/Cmd double-click viewport to hide the titlebar, Ctrl/Cmd drag viewport to move the window.
* Random file navigation (Go -> Random File, or "r" keyboard shortcut) to browse randomly without changing sort mode.
* Navigate between images when scrolling sideways (e.g. two finger swipe).
* Customizable mouse actions (e.g. change what double clicking or middle clicking does).
* Option to ignore certain file extensions when navigating through a folder.
* Show image loading errors inside viewport instead of as modal dialog.
* Improved performance during rapid image navigation when holding down the previous/next file shortcut keys, and configurable speed no longer linked to key repeat rate.
* Windows: Option for different theme; non-native look but it allows for dark mode.
* macOS: Option to reuse existing window when launching with image.
* Configurable window positioning behavior after matching image size.
* More accurate zoom-to-fit plus customizable overscan setting.
* Option to hide mouse cursor in fullscreen mode.
* Option to keep window on top during slideshow.
* Option for checkerboard background.
* Option to disable icons in "Open Recent" and "Open With" submenus.
